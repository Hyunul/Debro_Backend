# Backend of the Capstone Design Project with "Team Debro"

This repo is the backend of the "Smart Plant Utilizing the Weather Service API," the theme of the university's graduation work. <br>
By default, the .env file is excluded, which makes it difficult to operate in practice, but it can be tested with api built on www.hyunul.com . <br>
You can check the api statement I wrote here.
