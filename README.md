# Backend for Capstone Design Project with "Debro"

This repo is the backend of the "Smart Plant Utilizing the Weather Service API," the theme of the university's graduation work.
By default, the .env file is excluded, which makes it difficult to operate in practice, but it can be tested with api built on www.hyunul.com .
Thanks for visiting.
